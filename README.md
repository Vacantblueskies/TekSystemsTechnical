# OPA Policy for S3 Bucket Access

## Edge Cases
1. Users with no role specified in the request.
2. Requests with roles similar to 'st-access-role' but not exactly matching(Ex. Case Sensitive, Encoded, etc.).
3. Users with invalid IP Addresses.

## Logging and Monitoring
1. We can use OPA's built-in logging features to log policy decisions but it would be better to integrate with AWS services like CloudWatch. We can use AWS Lambda functions to parse the logs generated by OPA and send them to CloudWatch.
2. Set up alerts for policy violations or unusual access patterns in SecurityHub. These could include access requests at odd hours, denied, and unusual requests(possible brute-forcing or other automated attacks.) and could be created by parsing the logs provided by OPA for specific values.
